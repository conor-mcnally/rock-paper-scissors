My attempt at a game of rock, paper, scissors using Javascript.
The game is set in 5 rounds, so 5 inputs are taken and an overall score of you versus the computer is outout in the developer console.
Open the HTML file in a browser, input your attempts.
Click inspect on the webpage and open the console by clicking the console tab to view the results.

Enjoy!
